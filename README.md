# Microsft x DJI: Drone Competition

This repository stores the training/testing datasets (originally from [here](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset)) altered for the captioned competition.

The models are trained using the dataset captured and tagged by all the collaborators. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tjtanaa/yolo-fruits-dataset-for-dji-wsdk-object-detection).
